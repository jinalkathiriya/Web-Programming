 <h2> Introduction</h2>
 <pre>
 HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
 It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
 HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. 
 Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
 A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. 
 This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand 
 it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. 
 The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
 HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, 
 images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. 
 HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0,
 but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.
 In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, 
 a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
 proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser 
 and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert 
 Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. 
 In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; 
 an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] 
first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 
elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, 
these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images,
 and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every 
 item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered 
 or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are 
 mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes 
 the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed
 in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting 
 commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However,
 the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes)
 rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively
 moved in this direction with CSS.

Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an 
HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan 
Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft 
expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom 
tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful 
prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", 
from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]

After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. 
In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be
 treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]

Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 
1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, 
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC
 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. 
 In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group 
 (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized
 on 28 October 2014.[14]

 <h2> About Html</h2>
 <pre>
	The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed 
	to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often 
	assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
 into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
 included cues for its appearance.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects 
such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create 
structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  surround 
and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display 
the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
 and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide 
 Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has 
 encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, 
 is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with JavaScript.

  <h2> About Java Script</h2>
 <pre>
	JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology 
	of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the 
	client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers 
	have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces 
(APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics 
facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers 
and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two 
languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

History
Creation at Netscape
The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible 
to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[12]
 The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser,
 Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13]

During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic 
behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development 
scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They
 pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, 
 while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]

Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax 
similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and
 its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 
 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][14]

The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the 
time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name
 a marketing ploy by Netscape.[15] But the original design purpose was in fact an entirely separate "language
 for the masses"[15] or "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites".[16] This was soon obviously 
 no longer the case with the advent of stand-alone JavaScript runtime environments like Netscape's LiveWire Pro
 Web development tool and Ajax, ServerJS, asm.js and node.js.

Adoption by Microsoft
Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, 
Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[17]

JavaScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these 
implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.[18][19] These differences made it 
difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of "best
 viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.[18][20]

  <h2> About CSS</h2>
 <pre>
 CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[23] 
 At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[24] 
 Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, a
 nd discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in 
 the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal 
 by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[26]

Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized
 Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.
 [27] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different 
 sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable.
 CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[27]

As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of 
web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of 
more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[28]
 made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed.
 The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. 
 The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[24] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN,
 wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different
 presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[28]

Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine 
different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.[27] Of these nine proposals, 
two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[23] and Stream-based Style 
Sheet Proposal (SSP).[26][29] Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves
 Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[30][31][32] Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal 
 in the Argo browser.[26] Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed 
 from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).[24]

Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, Illinois in
 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[24] Around this time the W3C was already being established and took an
 interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by Steven Pemberton. This
 resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos 
 were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon 
 of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996, Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative
 style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS).[24] The spec was never finished, and is deprecated.[33]
 By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.

Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB)
. Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working Group, chaired by Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM 
Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working Group, chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.

The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation
 of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which 
 was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.

In 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that 
already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation
 to Working Draft level.

  <h2> About PHP</h2>
 <pre>
 PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[8]
 It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and
 released in 1995.[9][10] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.
 [11] PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,[12][13] but it now stands for 
 the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[14]

PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented 
as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the
 interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image
 data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management 
 systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that 
 response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone
 graphical applications[15] and robotic drone control.[16] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.

The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. 
PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.[17]

The PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, with the original implementation 
acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow.

W3Techs reports that as of 2024, PHP is used by 76.6% of all websites whose programming language could be determined, 
and thereof 59.0% use PHP 7 which is outdated and known to be insecure,[18] meaning half of all websites are insecure.

History

Early history
PHP development began in 1993[9] when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs
 in C,[19][20] which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and 
 to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.

PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve the 
code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0"
 on the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on 8 June 1995.[1][21] This release already 
 had the basic functionality that PHP has today. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability 
 to embed HTML. The syntax resembled that of Perl, but was simpler, more limited, and less consistent.[12][11]
